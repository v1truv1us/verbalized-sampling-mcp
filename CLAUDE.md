What would you like to run? I see several scripts available:

- `bun run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `bun run dev` - Watch mode for development
- `bun run start` - Start the server
- `bun test` - Run tests
- `bun run typecheck` - Type checking
- `bun run lint` - Linting

Which command should I execute?
